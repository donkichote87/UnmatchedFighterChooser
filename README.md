# UnmatchedGamesAPI

Very basic and extremely simple REST API providing currently published games/expansions in Unmatched Game System
(https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/295564/unmatched-game-system)

You can try it on heroku:
https://unmatched-games-api.herokuapp.com

Only endpoint at the moment is /games/ with method GET
(https://unmatched-games-api.herokuapp.com/games)

It doesn't require any parameters returns JSON encoded list of all Unmatched Games with list of Fighters in each game

I don't own Unmatched franchise and this API was not made for any commercial purpose, just simply for training and using it myself
