# UnmatchedGamesAPI

Very basic and extremely simple REST API providing currently published games/expansions in Unmatched Game System 
https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/295564/unmatched-game-system

Only endpoint is /games/ with method GET

It doesn't require any parameters returns JSON encoded list of all Unmatched Games with list of Fighters in each game

I don't own Unmatched franchise and this API was not made for any commercial purpose, just simply for training and using it myself
